# Advent of Code solutions

This repository stores my solutions to the Advent of Code programming problems.
This code is free for anyone to use and hopefully learn from.

## Repository structure

The repository is structured by year, and then by language. Input files can
be placed in the year's folder. For each year and language combination, there is
a way using common language tooling and idioms to run each day's solution
individually by providing the day's input file as an argument. In addition,
there is a way to run the entire suite of solutions for the year/language
combination by providing the folder that all of the input files are in.
