# Advent of Code 2020 - Rust
## Running the entire suite

Name your input files `<DAY>.txt` (e.g. `1.txt`) and place them in a folder together. Run `cargo run` with the folder name as an argument, e.g.:

```sh
$ cargo run ..
```

## Running a single day

Run `cargo run --bin day<DAY>` (e.g. `cargo run --bin day1`) with the input file name as an argument, e.g.:

```sh
$ cargo run --bin day1 ../1.txt
```
