# Advent of Code 2020 - C

## Requirements

- A C compiler (gcc or clang) capable of standard C17

## Running the entire suite

Build the binary `make advent2020`. Name your input files `<DAY>.txt` (e.g. `1.txt`) and place them in a folder together. Run `bin/advent2020` with the folder name as an argument, e.g.:

```sh
$ bin/advent2020 ..
```

## Running a single day

Build the binary `make day<DAY>` (e.g. `make day1`). Run `bin/day<DAY>` (e.g. `bin/day1`) with the input file name as an argument, e.g.:

```sh
$ bin/day1 ../1.txt
```
